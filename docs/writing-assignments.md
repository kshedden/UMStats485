# Writing assignments

See the syllabus and "writing tips" document for guidance on how to prepare
these reports.

All assignments are due at midnight (11:59pm) on the date stated below.

* (September 19th) Write a memo documenting a specific research question
that can be addressed using the BHHT (Brief History of Human Time) data,
the methods that you use to address this question, and your findings.
Your question and approach should align with the material presented in the
course lecture, focusing either on the lifespans or representation of people based
on their reported characteristics.  For this first assignment, you can
borrow generously from the findings and code discussed in class, but please
aim to report at least one novel finding.

* (October 3rd) Write a memo documenting a specific research question
that can be addressed using the US natality data.  Your question should
build on the class discussions focusing on demographic characteristics
associated with higher or lower birth counts in a county.  You should
primarily make use of Poisson regression and factor methods as discussed
in class, but your analysis should address a question that is considerably
deeper than we had time to develop during the discussions in lectures.

* (October 21st) Write a memo addressing a specific research question
that can be addressed using the Argo float data.  Your question should
account for the multivariate and functional structure of the data, considering
some aspect of the manner in which temperature and salinity vary with
pressure, how they covary with each other, and how these patterns of variation
and covariation may differ based on the location and time where the profile
was collected.

* (October 18th) Write a revision of either your BHHT or natality analysis
memo.  You can refine your research question if needed, or retain your
existing question.  It is acceptable to borrow extensively from your previous
memo, but the revised memo should also include substantial new analysis,
interpretation, or discussion.

* (November 6th) Write a memo addressing a specific research question
that can be addressed using the NHANES data, specifically focusing on
blood pressure as an outcome.  Your memo should consider the nonlinear
and non-additive relationships between several explanatory variables and
blood pressure, considering conditional mean blood pressure as well as other
aspects of its conditional distribution.

* (November 17th) Write a revision of your memo analyzing the Argo data.  As always, your two
pages should overwhelmingly focus on your specific research question, analysis
findings, and interpretation, along with critical review and exposition of the 
methods that you employ.  Be specific with your claims and precise with your
language.  You should use your previous Argo memo as a starting point but you
are welcome to incorporate different analysis approaches -- however these should
broadly reflect the approaches discussed in class.  Since this is a revision,
be especially aware of clarity, organization, and style.
